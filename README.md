# Library Management System (File-Based Java Console App)

A self-built, console-based Java application designed to manage library books using file-based persistence.  
This project focuses on core Java fundamentals, manual data handling, and structured program logic without relying on external databases or frameworks.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Library Management System** is a terminal-driven Java application that allows basic management of library books through direct file updates.  
All data is stored and maintained using local files, providing a clear understanding of how data persistence works at a fundamental level.

This project was built as part of a **self-reliant learning approach**, emphasizing logic, control flow, and file I/O before moving on to database-backed systems.

## 📚 Core Features

- Add new books to the library
- View all available books
- Update book details manually via file operations
- Remove books from records
- Persistent data storage using local files
- Simple and interactive console-based menu system

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** — Core programming language
- **File I/O (java.io / java.nio)** — Data persistence
- **Console I/O** — User interaction

---

## 🧠 System Design

- Menu-driven console interface
- File-based storage for book records
- Manual read/write operations for data updates
- Structured program flow with clear separation of logic
- Focus on simplicity, reliability, and clarity

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project was developed to strengthen understanding of:
- Java fundamentals and syntax
- File handling and persistence
- Data manipulation without databases
- Writing clean and maintainable console applications
- Understanding the foundation before abstraction layers

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the Java files using `javac`
3. Run the main class from the terminal
4. Interact with the system through the console menu
